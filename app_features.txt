----------------------------------------------------
Data Preprocessing:

Filter out users where churned is True.
Handle missing values.
Convert categorical variables to numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that might be useful, such as the duration of subscription, frequency of logins, etc.
Aggregate features like the total number of missed payments, total customer support tickets, etc.
Splitting the Data:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Selection:

Choose appropriate models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
Training the Model:

Train the model using the training dataset.
Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict the likelihood of churn for users where churned is False.
